    "There seem to be some interesting similarities and differences within the text collections based on our initial first look. For my partner's collection - Dracula - there seems to be a lot initial text metadata, license and usage policy at the beginning of the file which is different from the structure of my collection. Comparing the first sentence in both the texts we see that for 'Speeches.txt' the initial sentence more closely resembles a sentence structure, however, the first sentence of 'Dracula' contained all the text collection metadata and chapter numbers and titles, which is incorrect and hence may require additonal clean up before tokenization.\n",
    "A similarity amongst both texts was that initially the most common words for both contained mostly stop words and punctuations rather than meaningful words. Both texts revealed better insights for common words after removing stop words, punctuations and short words. We see that the longest word due the inclusion of hyphens as part of tokens was a phrase rather than a word in both the texts.  \n",

    "Some very interesting comparison can be done when looking at the text properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Both texts had similar average word length of approximately 6.7\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Number of words though similar in both the texts, 'Dracula' contained approximately 3000 more unique words than 'Trump Speeches' which might shed light on how Donald's Trump pattern on reiteration of his words and use of similar arguments in all his speeches (but it might be to premature to make such assumptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "-- The difference in the number of sentences and average sentence length show that 'Speeches.txt' contains almost double the number of sentences with almost half the sentence length. This is an intersting characteristic to note."
